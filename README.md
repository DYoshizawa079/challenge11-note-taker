# Challenge 11: Express.js note taker

## Description
A browser-based note taking app that was built to run on a node.js server combined with the express.js package. The application's frontend has already been created by another developer. My job is to build the backend, connect the two and deploy it on Heroku.

Deployment URL: [http://hidden-citadel-83426.herokuapp.com](http://hidden-citadel-83426.herokuapp.com)
